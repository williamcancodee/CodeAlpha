# CodeAlpha Hangman Game ✅

**Simple text-based Hangman written in Python**

---

## Overview 💡
A small, terminal-based Hangman game where the player guesses a secret word letter by letter. Intended as a beginner-friendly project and learning exercise.

## Features 🔧
- Small word list (5 words)
- Case-insensitive input
- Up to **6** incorrect guesses allowed
- Simple, easy-to-read code suitable for learning and modification

## Requirements ⚠️
- Python 3.8 or newer

## Installation & Usage ▶️
1. Open a terminal in the project folder (where `hangman_game.py` is located).
2. Run the game with:

```
python hangman_game.py
```

> Note: If your system uses `python3` as the command, use `python3 hangman_game.py` instead.

## How to Play 🎯
- The program will display blanks for each letter of the secret word.
- Type a single letter and press Enter to guess.
- Correct guesses reveal letters; incorrect guesses reduce the remaining attempts.
- The game ends when you guess the whole word or run out of attempts.
